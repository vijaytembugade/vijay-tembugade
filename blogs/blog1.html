          Imagine you are typing something and there is one software or program
          who keeps track of what you type on your keyboard. It takes a note of
          each and every key you press and record that data. Now, what if that
          data got leaked? You can imagine how harmful it is for you and your
          system. That data may include your social media passwords, your
          personal information and your banking data. That is how keylogger
          works. Keylogger collects the information and send back to a third
          party. That third party may use that information for any purpose. This
          is not only one case, what is keylogger software tries to collect your
          data like call recording, copy-pasted data, GPS locations, Screen
          grabs, even a microphone and camera.

          You can imagine how terrifying keylogger can be! Most of the time
          hackers try to collect the user data using Keylogger. But this is
          another condition, some of the companies use keylogger and related
          system for software testing and employee management. This system is
          called as Corporate Keylogging. Keylogger can be placed into a machine
          in different ways. Physical loggers are placed in input-output devices
          like wireless keyboards and touchpads. Software based Keylogger is
          precisely common and has various routes to enter in your system.
          Malware infected Apps and software, that we install in our system may
          also contain keylogger script So, the question arises here is, how we
          can protect from this keyloggers. Before installing any third-party
          module make sure you read all term and condition of them. Observing
          the resources allocated and background process may helpful for
          understanding the data flow and transmission. Usually keylogger needs
          a root access, so there we can capture the keylogging scripts. Using
          various trusted anti-virus and anti-keylogger software may help for
          our protection. Disabling self-running background apps and setting up
          a permission while connecting with external devices, may helpful to us
          to take over the key logging structure and its estimation.
