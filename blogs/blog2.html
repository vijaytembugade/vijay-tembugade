Socio-Tech Superstations
</h2>
      <div class="blog-content sub-title">

          It seems to be a different topic to read or listen but the ‘thing’ is common. Time has passed, science came and history breaths. But the ‘Thing’ remains same.
We remember, the black cat crosses our road then this is portent or ominous. Similarly, we do have some other thing too. Such are we cannot blow the whistle at night. Hope you all are thinking on right way, the SUPERSTATIONS. By the way these all are common topic and we can say them an Ancient Superstation. 
The question is why ancient? Because the time has changed and now we do have lots of “socio-tech superstations.” Technically under pressure of meaningless social media messages which are uncommon and disrespectful are socio-tech superstations.   

        </p>

          Hope, getting thing are complicated but the fact is true. ‘The superstations on social media’. The 21st century, we all are reaching towards not only moon but the sun also. The thing is our foundation is still on same beliefs and same consideration with some amount of evilness in mind.
Today we can see the trending messages on whatsapp, facebook and also twitter. These messages are   “yeh message 10 group me bhejo 24 ghante ke nader ek achi khabar sunayi degi aur agar apane aisa nahi kiya to apake sath bahut bura hoga….”   These types of idiot thing we are facing in the generation of science and internet. Although we all are aware of this but still can’t control them and system goes on and on.
Another famous message was “battery message - they were adding their own stuff and our mobile phone battery was getting fully charged….”  How ridiculous! We are trying to charge our battery by just forwarding the message, which is meaningless. Lots are there but we can’t discuss them all. 
The ‘thing’ is we are the youth, we are the future of nation. The future starts from us and end is infinite. But the direction we choose that must be specifically judged and knowledgeful. Saying that, just think a little while before forwarding any of those messages. Don’t let happen with you that these supernatural, superlogical, fantastic, irreplaceable, unbelievable, messages waiting for you to forward and share them. So be careful and aware of it and think before forwarding anything. 

        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly the game of life is ending at some point but not now. So, awareness and opening eyes are the theme of todays culture and tradition. But polluting and drinking same water is not a way to live a life. So, move and aware at least yourself for being the part of socio-tech superstations.
