         In the era of social media, we are having a lot of apps, platforms to express ourselves in front of the world. This social media became the voice of people. But the efficiency of such a thing depends on how we use it, whether it is profitably or negatively. Similarly, We do have a lot of apps to show our way or view to the world like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, WhatsApp, etc. Sometimes, We love to put stories and share things with family, friends and for this, these social media have a big amount of contribution. Every app has a unique feature, a unique way to show their utility. Instagram has a way to share, watch feeds, etc. Snapchat has a great filter, and a great community to share. Every app is special in this world. Similarly, one more app which is trending in this July 2019 is "FACE APP". It has a special feature of a lot of filters and a lot of interesting things.
FaceApp is a mobile application for androids and iOS. This app is developed by the â€˜Wireless Lab', which is a Russian company. FaceApp is Launched in January 2017. Mostly, this app became famous because of its filter, mainly the Old age filter, which shows the old look of a person. Respective to this it also has a lot of feature like beard filter, young age filter. This app provides one dramatic entertainment factor. A lot of hashtags, challenges, and controversies are there regarding this app.

         Mostly, the main controversies are about its privacy policies and data storage. The question is how this app work? So, when a user uploads or click the photo in this for using a filter, then app asks us permission of media and camera, which is necessary for this. But the factor that matter is this app send this photo to their server and uses the algorithm over there. As Snapchat and Instagram also ask for same permission but they don't send these clicks on the server but they prosses it in the device only. But FaceApp sends same data to the server. This is because, though we have storage in phones the algorithms they are using were not handled or worked by our devices. So, they use a serves or cloud server for the working of algorithm and deep image processing.

         </p>
         <p>
Although App has a privacy concern, the factor which we should look around is, Which techniques are used in this app? FaceApp is an AI photo editor that enables users to edit their own or someone else's face. This process contains the technique of image processing and deep learning. Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans. It is a part of Machine Learning and AI. This includes a lot of face recognition algorithms and which goes through the source code and look for a colour pattern to represent the face. And Digital Image Processing means processing a digital image using a digital computer. We can also say that it is a use of computer algorithms, to get enhanced image either to extract some useful information. This processing and controlling the algorithms, the further techniques of these apps were developed. The App is developed user-friendly.

        <p>
          Now the criticism and controversies are about to the privacy policies and security of data. As this app shares a piece of information with its server there is a problem with security, when and how that data will be deleted from server and most importantly this app asks permission for or storage, so the question arises, whether they are stealing data from our devices and the most probably, what about privacy?
The founder of FaceApp, Mr. Yaroslav Goncharov confirmed about the privacy and data, is that company does not share any data to the third party and most of the data is deleted after 48 hours after work, from the server. The reason behind that company upload data to the cloud is performance and traffic. Also, the respective company described that this app is available without login, so the only photometric information is not the only thing which will be used as a sharing a data, so, the privacy concerns are more cleared with the respective company.
Although, In the age of this social media, what does it matter is to be acknowledgeable about everything. So, If you're using this app or whether not using this app, at least be aware of trending things which will help everyone to run in the world of competition.

Finally, FaceApp is a photo-morphing app that uses what it calls artificial intelligence and neural face transformations to make creepy, hilarious, weird, and sometimes fascinating alterations to faces. The app can use photos from your library or you can snap a photo within the app. If you've got a huge photo library, you'll like this app. The app can scan your photo library and pull out only the photos that feature faces. In short, the factor of entertainment and sharing cool logic behind the faces is the main motto of this app. Irrespective to its some amount of privacy concerns, this is AL-based face filtering app. Let's see what next to come to this way or like this, and this will be a great revolution in the field of application-based industries and machine learning as well as AI.
