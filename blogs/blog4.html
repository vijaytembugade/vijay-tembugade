The tiktok and Pubg banned!!!!
</h2>
      <div class="blog-content sub-title">
        <p >
         Most of the Indian are crazy about banned of tiktok and PUBG in India. The younger generation who is having addition of playing PUBG or making videos of Tiktok are separately hating the decisions of Supreme Court. By the way, PUBG is not totally banned in India, it is only banned in Gujarat. But the download of TikTok is banned in India. Although tiktok is banned of downloading only, still user are allowed to make new videos and spend time on it. But, what do you think about ban of tiktok? We are Indian, aren’t we? And we are allowed to something entertaining for society. Lots of tiktok user are not maker of tiktok video, but lots of them are viewers who spend their time on watching useless (not worthy) videos. I am not saying that all tiktok videos are useless. Some of them are really going well but this is not a platform to show your talent of lip-sync, isn’t it?
Most of tiktok video maker spend their day by day to upload a content on tiktok. Instead of making a video of 15 sec , why don’t they try for new things or to watch better content on YouTube , prime or Netflix. The other option they have is having physical communication to people. Reading new books, Working for NSS, Joining Drama or Theatre group, Writing  scripts or else to work personality development.
The part of being Tiktok user doesn’t mean that you should get a fame. The fame you can also get by other thing on social media. The life of every tiktok user is like vegetarian Tiger. Neither he has reputation in his own mind nor on surrounding. Spreading a new thing isn’t bad habit but spreading a new illogical thing is social crime which is not on our crime dictionary.
I am not blaming them for using tiktok. I do have problem of pages on Instagram and Facebook or any other social media who are going worst to make fame of useless video instead of original talent. This isn’t mean pages that we are using doesn’t have any sense , actually they also need something new to show on their media. But vigoursly, it is going beyond the limits. Some of tiktok user are really performing well on their level but problem is not satisfactorily on the generation of new network or new content, where viewers are totally grown on their mind for content and they need something unique. Some of tiktok user brining it very carefully, as they will get attention easily. But attention on social media is timeless or we can say that for minute timing, but this is not life. The Pages on Instagram, sometime they are doing it worse, for trolling the person. They don’t have any idea how they feel for being a part of troll, whether, this trolling is bad or sometime it is for fame also.

We know the story of lion and rabbit. Where lion want to eat new animal every day. One day its rabbit time to part of lion’s food. So, rabbit make an idea to fool the lion and he shows the lion a well and lion is so fool that he falls in talking of rabbit. Rabbit bring lion to well and show to lion the reflection of lion itself to him, and foolishly lion jump into the well for defeating his reflection without thinking. This is case of PUBG user in India. They are foolishing themselves by showing world by being self-satisfactorily. But actually, they are not satisfied with them. They are thinking like as we are wining in PUBG that we are the only one where no one can defeat us. But happiness they are enjoying is fleeting or momentary or temporary only which is no longer will counted in your life ‘s journey. Actually, second handly, we can also say that small amount of happiness contains the real happiness. And which is worth also. But Spending hours and hours on playing PUBG is not happiness. It is your loss but they cannot understand it. Time has time too, so he can’t stop for anyone. Similarly, it is okay to play PUBG a while, but it is worst to play PUBG for 4 to 8 hours a day. And talking loudly to friend on PUBG for while is also bad habit, instead, they should try to speak friends who are nearer to you.
Logically Conclusion of this ban and anti-ban is depend upon use of user. Because today SC banned tiktok, but user again find new way to do same thing. For temporarily, it is okay. But the solution that is required is for being away the new generation from like this apps and extra active on social media is to keep busy them with other steps. I again want to say thing is another reason for spending time on this apps are unemployment and lack of skills. 

         </p>
         <p>
Again, lot of solutions are there that putting time restriction on apps and daily user. And ban on those who do illogical things on app like tiktok and Instagram. Specifically, Nudity and semi-naked foolish people. Lot of people getting addicted to these things and one day the day will come where everyone is busy with their stuff and no body care about anyone. People are dying on road and people will make a video and share it on WhatsApp but no one will come and help them. This is because everyone wants a fame in their work. But temporary fame is not an achievement. The real achievement is helping other, making you parents proud, doing something which is beneficiary for society, truthful satisfaction to the mind is real fame or real thing in this word. Because everybody is busy, everybody is specific with their time. So, nobody has a time to check the fame of other. Nobody, give a fuck to your work unless it is useful for them. Lastly, what we have to do is self-awareness between ourselves. 
Whatever it takes to change is “Time”. So, Lets give a chance to everyone who are using this apps and performing for fame or being self-satisfactorily by playing Games. And becoming part of this useless things. Those who do thing on tiktok and PUBG are good to say that they have at least time. But Foolishes are those who watch them doing this. For, example, watching tiktok video on Instagram or tiktok, and watching PUBG streaming. PUBG streams only want the capital, for that they go to any stage of their life or any stage for entertaining people. But the wisdom should be given to them those who watch them.

Don’t you think that, before some year where children used to play games on ground, swimming, fighting and again being together. But today we have so less amount of this kind of children. One of the reasons for this is less price of DATA, that we are using now. Although it is your decision, that how you use it. Watching porn and playing Games hours and hours is not good thing for generation. The thing that they have to do is different and they have to work for is different. Music, Movies, Drama, Reading, Writing, schooling, traveling, working for help, learning new and lot other things are solution for this.
</p>
<p>
The conclusion is awareness and self-control to do things. Not getting addicted, Not getting into time consuming useless things. The more you get the new things, the more you get perfect. The more you get new thing, the more you get addicted. The more you get new thing, the more you get habit of it. The more you get new things, the more you learn. The more you get new things, the more become confidential. The more you get new thing, the more you get solution. The more you get, more want, and more you search. So, search for positive in everything you learn and destroy the negativity.
